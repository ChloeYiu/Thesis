\section{Training, Calibration, and Testing}

\subsection{Data Construction}
Source of Data

Number of samples for training, calibration and testing data

Percentage of positive concepts for each type of concepts. Scores distribution for each data.

\subsection{Process of Training, Calibration, and Testing}
The steps: training (grp06), calibration (cal01), measuring model accuracy (dev02), extracting CAV (grp06), measuring CAV accuracy (grp06), measuring gradient distance (dev02 for gradient), including what data is used for each.

\section{Hyper-parameters}

The architecture of the original BERT, feature and wav2vec model

Ensemble seed

\section{Model Biasing}

Adding 1 mark, maximum 6 marks to candidates related to the concept

\section{Factor Isolation}

Use of BERT-like architecture for feature model

Use of DNN instead of DDN for feature model

Deep fusion of feature and BERT attention

\section{Performance Criteria}
Model accuracy (what is RMSE, PCC, $<0.5$, $<1$)

CAV accuracy

Gradient distance for bias
