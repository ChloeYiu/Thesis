\section{Introduction}
What is CAV

\section{Extraction of CAV}
Use linear classification to separate two classes with a linear decision boundary. CAV is its normal

Balanced weighting or no weighting

\section{Perturbation of CAV}

Candidate score changes if CAV related

\section{Gradient-based Method}

Measure gradient to determine bias
