\section{Grader Performance}
\subsection{Model Accuracy}
RMSE, MSE, $<0.5$, $<1$ measures, pre and post calibration - all are decent.

\subsection{CAV Accuracy}

Positive and negative concept success rates, both no weighting and balanced weighting.

\subsection{Gradient Distance for Bias}

Plot the gradient distance graphs and the tables of the three model.

\subsection{Model Biasing}
Plot the graph showing the gradient distance with vs without biased model - show whether CAV can actually measure bias.

\section{Factor Isolation}
\subsection{Architecture of Network}
Try using the text-based architecture, but feed in feature vector.

Compare model accuracy, CAV accuracy, and gradient distance from the original text-based model.

\subsection{Model Type}
Change feature-based model from DDN to DNN,.

Compare model accuracy, CAV accuracy, and gradient distance from the original feature-based model.

\subsection{Nature of Input}
Concatenate input with both feature and attention from text, retain text-based architecture.

Compare model accuracy, CAV accuracy, and gradient distance from the original text-based model.
