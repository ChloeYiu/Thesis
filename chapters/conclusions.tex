Report investigates in CAV as a tool to measure bias. Extends to different models, different ways of extracting CAV.  Investigated deeper into factors affecting shape of gradient distance graph.

Feature-based has to largest gap, and variation of gap with higher scores. Wide dispersion.

Text-based has a decent gap, but a flat distance against score. Narrow dispersion.

Audio-based has small gap, and also flat distance against score. Narrow dispersion.

Balanced weighting is foudnt to improve CAV accuracy, but overall both weighting and no weighting have similar gradient distance graphs.

Factors further narrowed down to be the nature of input affecting the gradient distance graph.

Implication: On the whole gained understanding on what affects the CAV method's measurement.

Future work: investigate why feature based vs attention-based input cause the distribution pattern. Develop a theory on how gradient distance pattern is influenced.
