    I am sincerely thankful to my supervisor, Dr. Kate Knill, for their consistent support and guidance throughout the year in shaping my project and helping me produce results that extend beyond academic curiosity. Their insightful feedback and regular meetings were key to the success of this work.

    Thanks to Cambridge English Language Assessment, for support and access to data and resources. I also appreciate the helpful discussions and advice from members of the ALTA Speech Team.

    Finally, I express my gratitude to my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my time at University of Cambridge, making this journey both enjoyable and fulfilling.
