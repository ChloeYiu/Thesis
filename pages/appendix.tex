\chapter{Risk Assessment}
This appendix outlines the risk assessment conducted for the project. The primary risks identified included repetitive strain injury (RSI) from prolonged typing, eye strain from extended exposure to bright screens, and potential hazards such as tripping over cables or burns from overheated computer components. These risks were mitigated through the following measures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Regular breaks were scheduled to reduce strain from typing and allow recovery for finger joints.
    \item The workspace was equipped with adequate lighting, proper ventilation, and ensured no trailing cables were present.
    \item Desk height was adjusted to maintain a 90-degree angle at the elbows while typing.
    \item The screen height was set to minimize neck and shoulder strain.
\end{itemize}
